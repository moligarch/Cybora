# Cybora: The Ultimate Open-Source Security Ecosystem

## Overview

**Cybora** is (going to be) a cutting-edge, modular security ecosystem designed to protect organizations against modern cyber threats. Built from scratch using **C/C++**, **Go**, and **Python**, Cybora leverages advanced technologies like **eBPF**, **XDP**, and custom implementations to deliver high-performance, scalable, and integrable security solutions. Inspired by war literature, each product in the ecosystem is named to reflect its role in defending against modern cyber attacks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Technologies Used

- eBPF: For efficient kernel-level tracing and packet filtering.
- XDP: For high-performance packet processing and DDoS protection.
- C/C++: For low-level, high-performance modules.
- Go: For concurrent and scalable backend services.
- Python: For scripting and auxiliary modules (if needed).
