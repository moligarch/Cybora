# CyborWall Roadmap

Below is a initial roadmap for developing CyborWall, broken into modules and iterations. Each iteration focuses on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then improving it over time. It might change as we may process with better idea.

## Iteration 1: MVP - Basic Packet Filtering

**Goal**: Build a functional firewall that can filter packets based on simple rules.

### Modules to Implement

1. Packet Capture Module

  - Use XDP to capture incoming packets at the kernel level.
  - Implement basic packet parsing (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP headers).

2. Rule Engine

  - Create a simple rule engine in C or Go to define filtering rules (e.g., block/allow by IP, port, or protocol).
  - Example rule format:
	```json
	{
		"action": "block",
		"src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
		"dst_port": "80"
	}
	```
		
3. Filtering Module

  - Use XDP to drop or allow packets based on rules.
  - Log filtered packets for debugging and monitoring.

4. CLI Interface

  - Build a simple command-line interface (CLI) to add, remove, and list rules.

### Deliverables

  - A working firewall that can block/allow traffic based on basic rules.
  - Logs for filtered packets.
  - CLI for rule management.
  - Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.

## Iteration 2: Stateful Firewall

**Goal**: Add stateful inspection to track connections and improve filtering accuracy.

### Modules to Implement

1. Connection Tracking

  - Implement a connection tracking table to monitor active TCP/UDP sessions.
  - Use eBPF maps to store connection states (e.g., SYN, ESTABLISHED, FIN).

2. Stateful Rule Engine

  - Extend the rule engine to support stateful rules (e.g., allow established connections).
  - Example rule:
	```json
	{
		"action": "allow",
		"state": "established"
	}
	```
		
3. Logging and Monitoring

  - Enhance logging to include connection states and filtered traffic details.

### Deliverables

  - A stateful firewall that tracks connections and applies rules based on connection states.
  - Improved logging and monitoring capabilities.
  - Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.

## Iteration 3: Advanced Filtering

**Goal**: Add support for advanced filtering features like deep packet inspection (DPI) and rate limiting.

### Modules to Implement

1. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

  - Implement basic DPI to inspect payloads for specific patterns (e.g., HTTP headers, DNS queries).
  - Use **eBPF** to analyze packet payloads in the kernel.

2. Rate Limiting

  - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., limit connections per second from a single IP).
  - Use **XDP** for high-performance rate limiting.

3. Rule Engine Enhancements

  - Extend the rule engine to support DPI and rate-limiting rules.
  - Example rule:
	```json
	{
		"action": "block",
		"protocol": "http",
		"pattern": "malicious-pattern",
		"rate_limit": "100/s"
	}
	```
		
### Deliverables

  - A firewall with DPI and rate-limiting capabilities.
  - Enhanced rule engine to support advanced filtering.
  - Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.

## Iteration 4: High Availability and Scalability

**Goal**: Make CyborWall scalable and fault-tolerant for enterprise use.

### Modules to Implement

1. Distributed Architecture

  - Implement a distributed architecture to handle traffic across multiple nodes.
  - Use Go for the control plane to manage rules and sync states across nodes.

2. Failover Mechanism

  - Add failover support to ensure uninterrupted service during node failures.

3. Performance Optimization

  - Optimize **XDP** and **eBPF** programs for maximum throughput.
  - Use zero-copy techniques to reduce overhead.

### Deliverables

  - A scalable and fault-tolerant firewall solution.
  - Optimized performance for high-traffic environments.
  - Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.

## Iteration 5: User Interface and Management

**Goal**: Provide a user-friendly interface for managing the firewall.

### Modules to Implement

1. Web-Based Dashboard

  - Build a web-based dashboard using Python (Flask/Django) or Go (Fiber).
  - Provide real-time traffic visualization, rule management, and logs.

2. API for Integration

  - Expose a REST API for integrating CyborWall with other Cybora products.

3. Alerting System

  - Add an alerting system to notify admins of suspicious activity or rule violations.

### Deliverables

  - A web-based dashboard for managing the firewall.
  - REST API for integration with other tools.
  - Alerting system for real-time notifications.
  - Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.

## Iteration 6: Advanced Threat Detection

**Goal**: Integrate threat intelligence and machine learning for proactive threat detection.

### Modules to Implement

1. Threat Intelligence Integration

  - Integrate with **CyborOracle** (Threat Intelligence) to block known malicious IPs and domains.

2. Machine Learning Module

  - Use machine learning to detect anomalies in traffic patterns.
  - Train models on historical traffic data to identify new threats.

3. Automated Response

	- Add automated response mechanisms to block threats in real-time.

### Deliverables

	- A firewall with advanced threat detection and automated response capabilities.
	- Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.

## Iteration 7: Final Polish and Optimization

**Goal**: Refine and optimize CyborWall for production use.

### Modules to Implement

1. Logging and Auditing

	- Add comprehensive logging and auditing for compliance and troubleshooting.

2. Performance Tuning

	- Fine-tune XDP and eBPF programs for maximum efficiency.

### Deliverables

	- A production-ready firewall with comprehensive documentation and testing.
	- Documentation and Testing
		+ Write detailed documentation for users and developers.
		+ Add unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests.
